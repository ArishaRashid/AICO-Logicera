AICO Web Summarization Agent - Problem Solving Approach

To build a web content summarization agent with conversational memory, I started by implementing multiple summarization techniques (stuffing, map-reduce, hierarchical, recursive, chain-of-thought, tree-of-thoughts, and adaptive) using LangChain and LangGraph. However, when integrating these with a conversational agent, I encountered persistent looping issues with the LangChain ReAct agent. I then simplified the approach by keeping the advanced summarization for the dedicated /summarize endpoint while implementing a simpler chat system using direct LLM calls with ConversationBufferWindowMemory to maintain the last 3 messages. The system uses OpenAI models (switched from HuggingFace for better performance), implements structured output parsing to separate main topic from summary, and provides a FastAPI backend with web scraping capabilities using httpx and BeautifulSoup for content extraction.
